Easily log and manage daily work achievements to boost transparency and productivity ðŸŒŸ

## Background
I got this idea from [here](https://code.dblock.org/2020/09/01/keep-a-changelog-at-work.html).

Here's a YouTube video demo and accompanying detailed notes. [TODO]

## Quick start

First, install BragLog using `pip` or `pipx`:

```bash
pip install braglog
```
Or with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):
```bash
pipx install braglog
```
Or with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/)
```bash
uv tool install braglog
```

## Simply log what you have achieved today
```shell
